In the performMarketAction(onRow,whichRow) the player indicates where the marble will be pushed, selecting by a boolean and integer which row or column will be modified.

The player will choose the resources to keep and where to store them. So, it will be created a TreeMap<WarehouseType,TreeMap<Resource,Integer>>, called resources_to_keep, to send to the server.

In each case if the TreeMap chosen is not valid, the client will come back to the choice of the resources to keep by the player.
