In the UseMarketMessage(int gameId, int playerId, boolean onRow,int index) the player indicates where the marble will be pushed, selecting by a boolean and an integer which row or column will be modified.

The player will choose the resources to keep and where to store them. So, it will be created a TreeMap<WarehouseType,TreeMap<Resource,Integer>>, called "toKeep", to send to the server.

In each case if the TreeMap chosen is not valid, the server will answer with an error and the client will come back to the choice of the resources to keep by the player.
