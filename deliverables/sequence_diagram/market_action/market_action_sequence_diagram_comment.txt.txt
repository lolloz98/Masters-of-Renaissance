In the performMarketAction(onRow,whichRow) the player indicates where the marble will be pushed, selecting by a boolean and integer which row or column will be modified.

The player could use an addictional functionality to put the resources in the depots in a smart way (first fill the leader depots and then the normal depots).

In the case of a smart distribution of resources choosen, the player will choose just the resources to keep. So, it will be created a TreeMap<Resource,Integer> , called resources_to_keep, to send to the server.

In the case of a normal distribution, the player will choose the resources to keep and where to store them. So, it will be created a TreeMap<WarehouseType,TreeMap<Resource,Integer>>, called resources_to_keep, to send to the server.

In each case if the TreeMap choosen is not valid, the client will come back to the choice of the resources to keep by the player.
